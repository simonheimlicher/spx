/**
 * Test Harness Verification
 *
 * These tests verify that withTestEnv() harness works correctly.
 * They demonstrate the basic usage pattern for Story-43's integration tests.
 *
 * NOTE: Full integration tests with validation functions are in Story-43.
 * This file just verifies the harness infrastructure itself.
