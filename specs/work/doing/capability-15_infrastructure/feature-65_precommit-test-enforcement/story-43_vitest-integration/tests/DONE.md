# Story Complete: Vitest Integration

## Summary

Implemented pre-commit test orchestration for vitest integration, enabling lefthook to run tests on staged files before commits.

## What Was Implemented

### Files Created

1. **`src/precommit/run.ts`** - Core orchestration module
   - `shouldRunTests(files)`: Pure function determining if tests should run
   - `runPrecommitTests(deps)`: Async orchestrator with dependency injection
   - `PRECOMMIT_RUN`: Constants for messages and exit codes
   - Type definitions for `PrecommitDeps`, `PrecommitResult`, `VitestResult`

2. **`bin/precommit.js`** - Entry point for lefthook
   - Loads from dist or uses tsx for development
   - Provides real `getStagedFiles()` using git diff
   - Provides real `runVitest()` using npx vitest

### Functional Requirements Satisfied

- **FR1**: Pre-commit script orchestrates test execution via `runPrecommitTests()`
- **FR2**: Skips tests when no relevant files changed via `shouldRunTests()`
- **FR3**: Clear output on test failure via constant messages and vitest output passthrough

### Quality Requirements Satisfied

- **QR1 (Type Safety)**: All functions have TypeScript type annotations
- **QR2 (Dependency Injection)**: Subprocess execution injectable, no `vi.mock()`
- **QR3 (Clear Error Messages)**: Constants define all user-facing messages

## Test Coverage

22 unit tests covering:

- `shouldRunTests()` - 10 tests
  - Test files detection
  - Source files detection
  - Non-relevant files rejection
  - Empty list handling
  - Mixed file handling

- `runPrecommitTests()` - 12 tests
  - Skip behavior for non-relevant files
  - Success path when tests pass
  - Failure path when tests fail
  - Exit code preservation
  - Vitest argument construction
  - Log message verification

## Tests to Graduate

Tests remain in `specs/.../tests/` as progress tests. They will graduate to `tests/unit/precommit/` when the feature is complete.

| Test File     | Destination                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `run.test.ts` | `tests/unit/precommit/run.test.ts` |

## Verification

```bash
# Tests pass
pnpm test specs/work/doing/capability-15_infrastructure/feature-65_precommit-test-enforcement/story-43_vitest-integration/tests/

# Validation passes
pnpm run validate

# Build succeeds
pnpm run build
```
